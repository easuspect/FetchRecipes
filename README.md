### Steps to Run the App
Open Recipe.xcodeproj. Hit the play button or Press command+R.
### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
I focused on writing clean and good code. I used modern patterns like MVVM to make the app scalable and easy to use. 
This helped the app work well and give a good experience. 
I chose these areas because they match Fetch’s focus on innovation and quality. 
I wanted to show that I care about doing great work.
### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
I spent about 6-7 hours on this project. I divided my time between designing a good structure, adding main features, and improving the code to make it clear and easy to work with. 
I also tested everything to make sure it worked well.
### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
I chose to focus more on performance and functionality instead of fancy visuals. 
I worked on making a strong and scalable base for the app that can have better UI designs added later. 
My main goal was to make the app stable and work well.
### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
The project could be better with more animations and nice UI details. 
But I focused on making a strong and working core first. 
This way, the app works well now and can be improved later.
### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
I’m very excited about the chance to join Fetch and work with such a great team. 
I worked on this project with lots of energy and tried my best to meet Fetch’s high standards and show how much I want to contribute.
